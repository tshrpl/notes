# 8:42 am
its almost 9am in the morning and i haven't slept all night,
pulling multiple all nighters can be dangerous to my mental
health so i'll go to sleep after i test some rust graphics
libraries, mainly `wgpu` and any other opengl libraries

# 9:07 am
`wgpu` it is

# 7:19 pm
i drifted into sleep at around 11:30 am and woke up at 6:30
pm. man, my sleep schedule is really f'ed up.
anyway, working on my `liquid_text` project cheered me up
a little bit, so back to my video
